    <p>
      I was born in Constantinople; my father was a dragoman at the Porte, and
      besides, carried on a fairly lucrative business in sweet-scented perfumes
      and silk goods. He gave me a good education; he partly instructed me
      himself, and also had me instructed by one of our priests. He at first
      intended me to succeed him in business one day, but as I showed greater
      aptitude than he had expected, he destined me, on the advice of his
      friends, to be a doctor; for if a doctor has learned a little more than
      the ordinary charlatan, he can make his fortune in Constantinople. Many
      Franks frequented our house, and one of them persuaded my father to allow
      me to travel to his native land to the city of Paris, where such things
      could be best acquired and free of charge. He wished, however, to take me
      with himself gratuitously on his journey home. My father, who had also
      travelled in his youth, agreed, and the Frank told me to hold myself in
      readiness three months hence. I was beside myself with joy at the idea of
      seeing foreign countries, and eagerly awaited the moment when we should
      embark. The Frank had at last concluded his business and prepared himself
      for the journey. On the evening before our departure my father led me into
      his little bedroom. There I saw splendid dresses and arms lying on the
      table. My looks were however chiefly attracted to an immense heap of gold,
      for I had never before seen so much collected together.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father embraced me and said: "Behold, my son, I have procured for thee
      clothes for the journey. These weapons are thine; they are the same which
      thy grandfather hung around me when I went abroad. I know that thou canst
      use them aright; but only make use of them when thou art attacked; on such
      occasions, how-over, defend thyself bravely. My property is not large;
      behold I have divided it into three parts, one part for thee, another for
      my support and spare money, but the third is to me a sacred and untouched
      property, it is for thee in the hour of need." Thus spoke my old father,
      tears standing in his eyes, perhaps from some foreboding, for I never saw
      him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journey passed off very well; we had soon reached the land of the
      Franks, and six days later we arrived in the large city of Paris. There my
      Frankish friend hired a room for me, and advised me to spend wisely my
      money, which amounted in all to two thousand dollars. I lived three years
      in this city, and learned what is necessary for a skilful doctor to know.
      I should not, however, be stating the truth if I said that I liked being
      there, for the customs of this nation displeased me; besides, I had only a
      few chosen friends there, and these were noble young men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The longing after home at last possessed me mightily; during the whole of
      that time I had not heard anything from my father, and I therefore seized
      a favorable opportunity of reaching home. An embassy from France left for
      Turkey. I acted as surgeon to the suite of the Ambassador and arrived
      happily in Stamboul. My father's house was locked, and the neighbors, who
      were surprised on seeing me, told me my father had died two months ago.
      The priest who had instructed me in my youth brought me the key; alone and
      desolate I entered the empty house. All was still in the same position as
      my father had left it, only the gold which I was to inherit was gone. I
      questioned the priest about it, and he, bowing, said: "Your father died a
      saint, for he has bequeathed his gold to the Church." This was and
      remained inexplicable to me. However, what could I do? I had no witness
      against the priest, and had to be glad that he had not considered the
      house and the goods of my father as a bequest. This was the first
      misfortune that I encountered. Henceforth nothing but ill-luck attended
      me. My reputation as doctor would not spread at all, because I was ashamed
      to act the charlatan; and I felt everywhere the want of the recommendation
      of my father, who would have introduced me to the richest and most
      distinguished, but who now no longer thought of the poor Zaleukos! The
      goods of my father also had no sale, for his customers had deserted him
      after his death, and new ones are only to be got slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus when I was one day meditating sadly over my position, it occurred to
      me that I had often seen in France men of my nation travelling through the
      country exhibiting their goods in the markets of the towns. I remembered
      that the people liked to buy of them, because they came from abroad, and
      that such a business would be most lucrative. Immediately I resolved what
      to do. I disposed of my father's house, gave part of the money to a trusty
      friend to keep for me, and with the rest I bought what are very rare in
      France, shawls, silk goods, ointments, and oils, took a berth on board a
      ship, and thus entered upon my second journey to the land of the Franks.
      It seemed as if fortune had favored me again as soon as I had turned my
      back upon the Castles of the Dardanelles. Our journey was short and
      successful. I travelled through the large and small towns of the Franks,
      and found everywhere willing buyers of my goods. My friend in Stamboul
      always sent me fresh stores, and my wealth increased day by day. When I
      had saved at last so much that I thought I might venture on a greater
      undertaking, I travelled with my goods to Italy. I must however confess to
      something, which brought me not a little money: I also employed my
      knowledge of physic. On reaching a town, I had it published that a Greek
      physician had arrived, who had already healed many; and in fact my balsam
      and medicine gained me many a sequin. Thus I had at length reached the
      city of Florence in Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I resolved upon remaining in this town for some time, partly because I
      liked it so well, partly also because I wished to recruit myself from the
      exertions of my travels. I hired a vaulted shop, in that part of the town
      called Sta. Croce, and not far from this a couple of nice rooms at an inn,
      leading out upon a balcony. I immediately had my bills circulated, which
      announced me to be both physician and merchant. Scarcely had I opened my
      shop when I was besieged by buyers, and in spite of my high prices I sold
      more than any one else, because I was obliging and friendly towards my
      customers. Thus I had already lived four days happily in Florence, when
      one evening, as I was about to close my vaulted room, and on examining
      once more the contents of my ointment boxes, as I was in the habit of
      doing, I found in one of the small boxes a piece of paper, which I did not
      remember to have put into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I unfolded the paper, and found in it an invitation to be on the bridge
      which is called Ponto Vecchio that night exactly at midnight. I was
      thinking for a long time as to who it might be who had invited me there;
      and not knowing a single soul in Florence, I thought perhaps I should be
      secretly conducted to a patient, a thing which had already often occurred.
      I therefore determined to proceed thither, but took care to gird on the
      sword which my father had once presented to me. When it was close upon
      midnight I set out on my journey, and soon reached the Ponte Vecchio. I
      found the bridge deserted, and determined to await the appearance of him
      who called me. It was a cold night; the moon shone brightly, and I looked
      down upon the waves of the Arno, which sparkled far away in the moonlight.
      It was now striking twelve o'clock from all the churches of the city, when
      I looked up and saw a tall man standing before me completely covered in a
      scarlet cloak, one end of which hid his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first I was somewhat frightened, because he had made his appearance so
      suddenly; but was however myself again shortly afterwards, and said: "If
      it is you who have ordered me here, say what you want?" The man dressed in
      scarlet turned round and said in an undertone:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Follow!" At this, however, I felt a little timid to go alone with this
      stranger. I stood still and said: "Not so, sir, kindly first tell me
      where; you might also let me see your countenance a little, in order to
      convince me that you wish me no harm." The red one, however, did not seem
      to pay any attention to this. "If thou art unwilling, Zaleukos, remain,"
      he replied, and continued his way. I grew angry. "Do you think," I
      exclaimed, "a man like myself allows himself to be made a fool of, and to
      have waited on this cold night for nothing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In three bounds I had reached him, seized him by his cloak, and cried
      still louder, whilst laying hold of my sabre with my other hand. His
      cloak, however, remained in my hand, and the stranger had disappeared
      round the nearest corner. I became calmer by degrees. I had the cloak at
      any rate, and it was this which would give me the key to this remarkable
      adventure. I put it on and continued my way home. When I was at a distance
      of about a hundred paces from it, some one brushed very closely by me and
      whispered in the language of the Franks: "Take care, Count, nothing can be
      done to-night." Before I had time, however, to turn round, this somebody
      had passed, and I merely saw a shadow hovering along the houses. I
      perceived that these words did not concern me, but rather the cloak, yet
      it gave me no explanation concerning the affair. On the following morning
      I considered what was to be done. At first I had intended to have the
      cloak cried in the streets, as if I had found it. But then the stranger
      might send for it by a third person, and thus no light would be thrown
      upon the matter. Whilst I was thus thinking, I examined the cloak more
      closely. It was made of thick Genoese velvet, scarlet in color, edged with
      Astrachan fur and richly embroidered with gold. The magnificent appearance
      of the cloak put a thought into my mind which I resolved to carry out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I carried it into my shop and exposed it for sale, but placed such a high
      price upon it that I was sure nobody would buy it. My object in this was
      to scrutinize everybody sharply who might ask for the fur cloak; for the
      figure of the stranger, which I had seen but superficially, though with
      some certainty, after the loss of the cloak, I should recognize amongst a
      thousand. There were many would-be purchasers for the cloak, the
      extraordinary beauty of which attracted everybody; but none resembled the
      stranger in the slightest degree, and nobody was willing to pay such a
      high price as two hundred sequins for it. What astonished me was that on
      asking somebody or other if there was not such a cloak in Florence, they
      all answered "No," and assured me they never had seen so precious and
      tasteful a piece of work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evening was drawing near, when at last a young man appeared, who had
      already been to my place, and who had also offered me a great deal for the
      cloak. He threw a purse with sequins upon the table, and exclaimed: "Of a
      truth, Zaleukos, I must have thy cloak, should I turn into a beggar over
      it!" He immediately began to count his pieces of gold. I was in a
      dangerous position: I had only exposed the cloak, in order merely to
      attract the attention of my stranger, and now a young fool came to pay an
      immense price for it. However, what could I do? I yielded; for on the
      other hand I was delighted at the idea of being so handsomely recompensed
      for my nocturnal adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man put the cloak around him and went away, but on reaching the
      threshold he returned; whilst unfastening a piece of paper which had been
      tied to the cloak, and throwing it towards me, he exclaimed: "Here,
      Zaleukos, hangs something which I dare say does not belong to the cloak."
      I picked up the piece of paper carelessly, but behold, on it these words
      were written: "Bring the cloak at the appointed hour to-night to the Ponte
      Vecchio, four hundred sequins are thine." I stood thunderstruck. Thus I
      had lost my fortune and completely missed my aim! Yet I did not think
      long. I picked up the two hundred sequins, jumped after the one who had
      bought the cloak, and said: "Dear friend, take back your sequins, and give
      me the cloak; I cannot possibly part with it." He first regarded the
      matter as a joke; but when he saw that I was in earnest, he became angry
      at my demand, called me a fool, and finally it came to blows.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I was fortunate enough to wrench the cloak from him in the
      scuffle, and was about to run away with it, when the young man called the
      police to his assistance, and we both appeared before the judge. The
      latter was much surprised at the accusation, and adjudicated the cloak in
      favor of my adversary. I offered the young man twenty, fifty, eighty, even
      a hundred sequins in addition to his two hundred, if he would part with
      the cloak. What my entreaties could not do, my gold did. He accepted it.
      I, however, went away with the cloak triumphantly, and had to appear to
      the whole town of Florence as a madman. I did not care, however, about the
      opinion of the people; I knew better than they that I profited after all
      by the bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Impatiently I awaited the night. At the same hour as before I went with
      the Cloak under my arm towards the Ponte Vecchio. With the last stroke of
      twelve the figure appeared out of the darkness, and came towards me. It
      was unmistakably the man whom I had seen yesterday. "Hast thou the cloak?"
      he asked me. "Yes, sir," I replied; "but it cost me a hundred sequins
      ready money." "I know it," replied the other. "Look here, here are four
      hundred." He went with me towards the wide balustrade of the bridge, and
      counted out the money. There were four hundred; they sparkled
      magnificently in the moonlight; their glitter rejoiced my heart. Alas, I
      did not anticipate that this would be its last joy. I put the money into
      my pocket, and was desirous of thoroughly looking at my kind and unknown
      stranger; but he wore a mask, through which dark eyes stared at me
      frightfully. "I thank you, sir, for your kindness," I said to him; "what
      else do you require of me? I tell you beforehand it must be an honorable
      transaction." "There is no occasion for alarm," he replied, whilst winding
      the cloak around his shoulders; "I require your assistance as surgeon, not
      for one alive, but dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" I exclaimed, full of surprise. "I arrived with my
      sister from abroad," he said, and beckoned me at the same time to follow
      him. "I lived here with her at the house of a friend. My sister died
      yesterday suddenly of a disease, and my relatives wish to bury her
      to-morrow. According to an old custom of our family all are to be buried
      in the tomb of our ancestors; many, notwithstanding, who died in foreign
      countries are buried there and embalmed. I do not grudge my relatives her
      body, but for my father I want at least the head of his daughter, in order
      that he may see her once more." This custom of severing the heads of
      beloved relatives appeared to me somewhat awful, yet I did not dare to
      object to it lest I should offend the stranger. I told him that I was
      acquainted with the embalming of the dead, and begged him to conduct me to
      the deceased. Yet I could not help asking him why all this must be done so
      mysteriously and at night? He answered me that his relatives, who
      considered his intention horrible, objected to it by daylight; if only the
      head were severed, then they could say no more about it; although he might
      have brought me the head, yet a natural feeling had prevented him from
      severing it himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime we had reached a large, splendid house. My companion
      pointed it out to me as the end of our nocturnal walk. We passed the
      principal entrance of the house, entered a little door, which the stranger
      carefully locked behind him, and now ascended in the dark a narrow spiral
      staircase. It led towards a dimly lighted passage, out of which we entered
      a room lighted by a lamp fastened to the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this room was a bed, on which the corpse lay. The stranger turned aside
      his face, evidently endeavoring to hide his tears. He pointed towards the
      bed, telling me to do my business well and quickly, and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took my instruments, which I as surgeon always carried about with me,
      and approached the bed. Only the head of the corpse was visible, and it
      was so beautiful that I experienced involuntarily the deepest sympathy.
      Dark hair hung down in long plaits, the features were pale, the eyes
      closed. At first I made an incision into the skin, after the manner of
      surgeons when amputating a limb. I then took my sharpest knife, and with
      one stroke cut the throat. But oh, horror! The dead opened her eyes, but
      immediately closed them again, and with a deep sigh she now seemed to
      breathe her last. At the same moment a stream of hot blood shot towards me
      from the wound. I was convinced that the poor creature had been killed by
      me. That she was dead there was no doubt, for there was no recovery from
      this wound. I stood for some minutes in painful anguish at what had
      happened. Had the "red-cloak" deceived me, or had his sister perhaps
      merely been apparently dead? The latter seemed to me more likely. But I
      dare not tell the brother of the deceased that perhaps a little less
      deliberate cut might have awakened her without killing her; therefore I
      wished to sever the head completely; but once more the dying woman
      groaned, stretched herself out in painful movements, and died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fright overpowered me, and, shuddering, I hastened out of the room. But
      outside in the passage it was dark; for the light was out, no trace of my
      companion was to be seen, and I was obliged, haphazard, to feel my way in
      the dark along the wall, in order to reach the staircase. I discovered it
      at last and descended, partly falling and partly gliding. But there was
      not a soul downstairs. I merely found the door ajar, and breathed freer on
      reaching the street, for I had felt very strange inside the house. Urged
      on by terror, I rushed towards my dwelling-place, and buried myself in the
      cushions of my bed, in order to forget the terrible thing that I had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      But sleep deserted me, and only the morning admonished me again to take
      courage. It seemed to me probable that the man who had induced me to
      commit this nefarious deed, as it now appeared to me, might not denounce
      me. I immediately resolved to set to work in my vaulted room, and if
      possible to assume an indifferent look. But alas! an additional
      circumstance, which I only now noticed, increased my anxiety still more.
      My cap and my girdle, as well as my instruments, were wanting, and I was
      uncertain as to whether I had left them in the room of the murdered girl,
      or whether I had lost them in my flight. The former seemed indeed the more
      likely, and thus I could easily be discovered as the murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the accustomed hour I opened my vaulted room. My neighbor came in, as
      was his wont every morning, for he was a talkative man. "Well," he said,
      "what do you say about the terrible affair which has occurred during the
      night?" I pretended not to know anything. "What, do you not know what is
      known all over the town? Are you not aware that the loveliest flower in
      Florence, Bianca, the Governor's daughter, was murdered last night? I saw
      her only yesterday driving through the streets in so cheerful a manner
      with her intended one, for to-day the marriage was to have taken place." I
      felt deeply wounded at each word of my neighbor. Many a time my torment
      was renewed, for every one of my customers told me of the affair, each one
      more ghastly than the other, and yet nobody could relate anything more
      terrible than that which I had seen myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      About mid-day a police-officer entered my shop and requested me to send
      the people away. "Signor Zaleukos," he said, producing the things which I
      had missed, "do these things belong to you?" I was thinking as to whether
      I should not entirely repudiate them, but on seeing through the door,
      which stood ajar, my landlord and several acquaintances, I determined not
      to aggravate the affair by telling a lie, and acknowledged myself as the
      owner of the things. The police-officer asked me to follow him, and led me
      towards a large building which I soon recognized as the prison. There he
      showed me into a room meanwhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      My situation was terrible, as I thought of it in my solitude. The idea of
      having committed a murder, unintentionally, constantly presented itself to
      my mind. I also could not conceal from myself that the glitter of the gold
      had captivated my feelings, otherwise I should not have fallen blindly
      into the trap. Two hours after my arrest I was led out of my cell. I
      descended several steps until at last I reached a great hall. Around a
      long table draped in black were seated twelve men, mostly old men. There
      were benches along the sides of the hall, filled with the most
      distinguished of Florence. The galleries, which were above, were thickly
      crowded with spectators. When I had stepped towards the table covered with
      black cloth, a man with a gloomy and sad countenance rose; it was the
      Governor. He said to the assembly that he as the father in this affair
      could not sentence, and that he resigned his place on this occasion to the
      eldest of the Senators. The eldest of the Senators was an old man at least
      ninety years of age. He stood in a bent attitude, and his temples were
      covered with thin white hair, but his eyes were as yet very fiery, and his
      voice powerful and weighty. He commenced by asking me whether I confessed
      to the murder. I requested him to allow me to speak, and related
      undauntedly and with a clear voice what I had done, and what I knew.
    </p>

      I noticed that the Governor, during my recital, at one time turned pale,
      and at another time red. When I had finished, he rose angrily: "What,
      wretch!" he exclaimed, "dost thou even dare to impute a crime which thou
      hast committed from greediness to another?" The Senator reprimanded him
      for his interruption, since he had voluntarily renounced his right;
      besides it was not clear that I did the deed from greediness, for,
      according to his own statement, nothing had been stolen from the victim.
      He even went further. He told the Governor that he must give an account of
      the early life of his daughter, for then only it would be possible to
      decide whether I had spoken the truth or not. At the same time he
      adjourned the court for the day, in order, as he said, to consult the
      papers of the deceased, which the Governor would give him. I was again
      taken back to my prison, where I spent a wretched day, always fervently
      wishing that a link between the deceased and the "red-cloak" might be
      discovered. Full of hope, I entered the Court of Justice the next day.
      Several letters were lying upon the table. The old Senator asked me
      whether they were in my handwriting. I looked at them and noticed that
      they must have been written by the same hand as the other two papers which
      I had received. I communicated this to the Senators, but no attention was
      paid to it, and they told me that I might have written both, for the
      signature of the letters was undoubtedly a Z., the first letter of my
      name. The letters, however, contained threats against the deceased, and
      warnings against the marriage which she was about to contract.

      The Governor seemed to have given extraordinary information concerning me,
      for I was treated with more suspicion and rigor on this day. I referred,
      to justify myself, to my papers which must be in my room, but was told
      they had been looked for without success. Thus at the conclusion of this
      sitting all hope vanished, and on being brought into the Court the third
      day, judgment was pronounced on me. I was convicted of wilful murder and
      condemned to death. Things had come to such a pass! Deserted by all that
      was precious to me upon earth, far away from home, I was to die innocently
      in the bloom of my life.

    <p>
      On the evening of this terrible day which had decided my fate, I was
      sitting in my lonely cell, my hopes were gone, my thoughts steadfastly
      fixed upon death, when the door of my prison opened, and in came a man,
      who for a long time looked at me silently. "Is it thus I find you again,
      Zaleukos?" he said. I had not recognized him by the dim light of my lamp,
      but the sound of his voice roused in me old remembrances. It was Valetti,
      one of those few friends whose acquaintance I made in the city of Paris
      when I was studying there. He said that he had come to Florence
      accidentally, where his father, who was a distinguished man, lived. He had
      heard about my affair, and had come to see me once more, and to hear from
      my own lips how I could have committed such a crime. I related to him the
      whole affair. He seemed much surprised at it, and adjured me, as my only
      friend, to tell him all, in order not to leave the world with a lie behind
      me. I confirmed my assertions with an oath that I had spoken the truth,
      and that I was not guilty of anything, except that the glitter of the gold
      had dazzled me, and that I had not perceived the improbability of the
      story of the stranger. "Did you not know Bianca?" he asked me. I assured
      him that I had never seen her. Valetti now related to me that a profound
      mystery rested on the affair, that the Governor had very much accelerated
      my condemnation, and now a report was spread that I had known Bianca for a
      long time, and had murdered her out of revenge for her marriage with some
      one else. I told him that all this coincided exactly with the "red-cloak,"
      but that I was unable to prove his participation in the affair. Valetti
      embraced me weeping, and promised me to do all, at least to save my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had little hope, though I knew that Valetti was a clever man, well
      versed in the law, and that he would do all in his power to save my life.
      For two long days I was in uncertainty; at last Valetti appeared. "I bring
      consolation, though painful. You will live and be free with the loss of
      one hand." Affected, I thanked my friend for saving my life. He told me
      that the Governor had been inexorable in having the affair investigated a
      second time, but that he at last, in order not to appear unjust, had
      agreed, that if a similar case could be found in the law books of the
      history of Florence, my punishment should be the same as the one recorded
      in these books. He and his father had searched in the old books day and
      night, and at last found a case quite similar to mine. The sentence was:
      That his left hand be cut off, his property confiscated, and he himself
      banished for ever. This was my punishment also, and he asked me to prepare
      for the painful hour which awaited me. I will not describe to you that
      terrible hour, when I laid my hand upon the block in the public
      market-place and my own blood shot over me in broad streams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valetti took me to his house until I had recovered; he then most
      generously supplied me with money for travelling, for all I had acquired
      with so much difficulty had fallen a prey to the law. I left Florence for
      Sicily and embarked on the first ship that I found for Constantinople.
    </p>
    <p>
      My hope was fixed upon the sum which I had entrusted to my friend. I also
      requested to be allowed to live with him. But how great was my
      astonishment on being asked why I did not wish to live in my own house. He
      told me that some unknown man had bought a house in the Greek Quarter in
      my name, and this very man had also told the neighbors of my early
      arrival. I immediately proceeded thither accompanied by my friend, and was
      received by all my old acquaintances joyfully. An old merchant gave me a
      letter, which the man who had bought the house for me had left behind. I
      read as follows: "Zaleukos! Two hands are prepared to work incessantly, in
      order that you may not feel the loss of one of yours. The house which you
      see and all its contents are yours, and every year you will receive enough
      to be counted amongst the rich of your people. Forgive him who is
      unhappier than yourself!" I could guess who had written it, and in answer
      to my question, the merchant told me it had been a man, whom he took for a
      Frank, and who had worn a scarlet cloak. I knew enough to understand that
      the stranger was, after all, not entirely devoid of noble intentions. In
      my new house I found everything arranged in the best style, also a vaulted
      room stored with goods, more splendid than I had ever had. Ten years have
      passed since. I still continue my commercial travels, more from old custom
      than necessity, yet I have never again seen that country where I became so
      unfortunate. Every year since, I have received a thousand gold-pieces; and
      although I rejoice to know that unfortunate man to be noble, yet he cannot
      relieve me of the sorrow of my soul, for the terrible picture of the
      murdered Bianca is continually on my mind.
